# 🌟 **Fine-Tuning LLaMA 3.2 3B for Kannada Language Adaptation** 🌟  

At **XYZ Company**, we adopted the **LLaMA 3.2 (3B) model** as the core **AI foundation for our product** to provide cutting-edge AI-driven solutions. However, due to our **large Kannada-speaking user base**, the model required fine-tuning to better cater to their needs. After analyzing its performance, our **manager decided** that fine-tuning on a Kannada-specific dataset was essential to enhance the model’s effectiveness.


To achieve this, we are leveraging the **Hugging Face dataset** `charanhu/kannada-instruct-dataset-390k`, containing **390,000 high-quality rows of Kannada instructions**. This dataset serves as the foundation for fine-tuning the model to:  
-  **Better understand Kannada**: Improve comprehension of the language’s syntax, semantics, and nuances.  
-  **Generate accurate responses**: Ensure the model aligns with Kannada-speaking users' expectations and use cases.  
-  **Enhance the overall user experience**: Build a model that feels intuitive and responsive to Kannada-related queries.  




### **My Role as a Developer** 🎋  

As a developer, I am responsible for delivering a Instruction fine-tuned **LLaMA 3.2 3B** model that aligns with the defined **Key Performance Indicator (KPI)** objectives and ensures exceptional performance for Kannada-speaking users.  

- I will **instruct fine-tune** the model using the high-quality **Kannada dataset** from **Hugging Face** (`charanhu/kannada-instruct-dataset-390k`).  

- To address the constraints of **limited GPU resources**, I will implement **QLoRA-based 4-bit precision quantization** using **Unsloth**, which involves:  
  - First **quantizing the model** to 4-bit precision to reduce computational overhead.  
  - Adding **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) layers** to fine-tune the model efficiently within **Google Colab**, ensuring optimal resource utilization without compromising performance.  

- This project is being executed under a **tight deadline**, which requires a strategic focus on both **efficiency and quality**.  

I will collaborate closely with the **AI Systems Team** and **prompt engineers** to ensure the fine-tuning process adheres to business objectives and meets user requirements.

###  Project System Design (or pipeline) 🎋🌿

### **Finetuning Pipeline**  
- The **finetuning process** will be executed only once for this project.  
- **Quantization using `unsloth`:** The model is quantized to 4-bit precision, optimizing it for faster and more efficient finetuning.  
- **Fine-tuning LoRA layers:** These are trained in 16-bit precision for better accuracy. After fine-tuning, the LoRA layers are merged back into the quantized model.  
- Once fine-tuning is complete, the **merged model** along with the tokenizer is uploaded to an **S3 bucket**. This provides a centralized storage location and ensures that the model and tokenizer are ready for deployment or future use.  

  - While this modular structure is prepared for scalability, **for this project**, the fine-tuning is executed in a **Colab-based Jupyter Notebook**. This is because the computational requirements of fine-tuning necessitate the use of external GPU resources available in Colab. From this experimental notebook, the fine-tuned model and tokenizer are pushed directly to S3.  
  - The modular code in `src/finetuning` ensures that if fine-tuning is required again in the future, any developer can easily understand and reuse the logic by running the code independently.  



## Now let's Talk about the Pipeline  🚀

*This is the diagram, of how the pipeline will look:*

![Finetuning Pipeline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc09764b-b5a1-4614-b872-cc6d9cd88bdc)


*Note: Fine-tuning code will be entirely modular, but I have used **Google Colab** for training, if you have high-end machine make sure you execute **pipeline** in modular fashion*

## Fine-tuning Pipeline 💥
**Note:** The fine-tuning pipeline code is modularized in the `src/finetuning` folder of this repository. If you have access to **high-performance resources** like AWS SageMaker or high-end GPUs, you can execute the modularized files in sequence: start with the **Trainer** to fine-tune the model, then proceed to **Inference** for generating predictions, followed by the **Merge Models** file to combine the fine-tuned model with the base model, and finally, use the **Push to S3** script to upload the final model and tokenizer to your S3 bucket. However, if you lack access to higher-end GPUs or a cloud budget, I recommend using **Google Colab's free tier**. In this case, skip the modularized part and directly execute the provided Jupyter Notebook inside `notebooks/` to fine-tune the model, then upload the `model` and `tokenizer` directly to S3 from the Colab notebook. **Caution:** The modularized pipeline has not been tested thoroughly because I do not have access to high-end compute resources. If you encounter issues while running the pipeline, please raise an issue in the repository, and I will address it immediately.

###  Training Configurations

<img width="614" alt="Training Configuration" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/956acc04-ac6f-497b-9c12-9cc33b70301b">

- **Initializing Fine-Tuning with SFTTrainer**:  
  - **Purpose**: Fine-tuning the model by training LoRA layers while keeping the quantized base model frozen.  

- **Key Components**:  
  - **`model`**:  
    - Contains the quantized base model with LoRA layers for efficient parameter updates.  
    - Only LoRA layers are trainable; the base model remains static.  
  - **`tokenizer`**: Used to preprocess input data into a format compatible with the model.  
  - **`train_dataset`**: The dataset to fine-tune the model, here set to the formatted **`dataset`**.  
  - **`dataset_text_field`**: Specifies the field in the dataset containing formatted text data (key: **`text`**).

  - **`dataset_num_proc`**: Sets parallel processing to **2 threads** for efficiency during data preparation.  
  - **`packing`**: Disables input packing to keep data unaltered.  

### **`TrainingArguments`** Parameters:

- **`per_device_train_batch_size`**:  
  - Defines the number of training samples processed simultaneously on each GPU or CPU.  
  - In this case, **4 samples per device**, which means if multiple GPUs are used, the total effective batch size will be multiplied by the number of GPUs.  

- **`gradient_accumulation_steps`**:  
  - Accumulates gradients over **4 mini-batches** before performing a single optimizer step.  
  - This allows for the simulation of a larger batch size while using less memory, effectively making the batch size = `per_device_train_batch_size × gradient_accumulation_steps`.  
  - Example: Here, the effective batch size becomes **4 × 4 = 16**.  

- **`warmup_steps`**:  
  - Gradually increases the learning rate over **20 steps** at the beginning of training.  
  - Prevents sudden large updates to weights, stabilizing training and reducing the risk of exploding gradients.  

- **`max_steps`**:  
  - Specifies the **maximum number of training steps**.  
  - Training will terminate after completing **300 steps**, regardless of the number of epochs completed.  

- **`learning_rate`**:  
  - Controls the rate at which model weights are updated.  
  - A smaller value like **1.5e-4** ensures slow and stable convergence, especially critical for fine-tuning large models.  

- **`fp16` and `bf16`**:  
  - **`fp16`**: Mixed-precision training using 16-bit floating-point numbers, which speeds up training and reduces memory usage.  
  - **`bf16`**: Alternative to `fp16`, supported on newer hardware like **NVIDIA A100 GPUs**, with better numerical stability.  
  - **Logic**: If the system supports **`bfloat16`**, it will use it; otherwise, it defaults to **`fp16`**.  

- **`logging_steps`**:  
  - Logs metrics (e.g., loss, learning rate) every **10 steps**, helping monitor training progress.  

- **`optim`**:  
  - Specifies the optimizer used for weight updates, here **`adamw_8bit`**, which is a memory-efficient version of the Adam optimizer.  
  - Suitable for training large models with reduced memory usage while maintaining performance.  

- **`weight_decay`**:  
  - Applies a regularization penalty of **0.02** to model weights, helping prevent overfitting.  

- **`lr_scheduler_type`**:  
  - Adjusts the learning rate dynamically during training.  
  - **`linear` scheduler**: Decreases the learning rate linearly from its initial value to zero as training progresses.  

- **`seed`**:  
  - Sets the random seed to **3407** for ensuring reproducibility.  
  - Fixes randomness in data shuffling, weight initialization, and other stochastic processes.  

- **`output_dir`**:  
  - Specifies the directory where training outputs (e.g., model checkpoints, logs) are saved.  
  - Example: All artifacts will be stored in the folder **`outputs`**.  

- **Final Output**:  
  - The **`trainer`** object manages the training loop, including data preprocessing, forward/backward passes, and logging.  
  - Fine-tunes LoRA layers to enhance the model's performance on the provided dataset.  











### Model Training

<img width="856" alt="Model  Training" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075ee343-8412-4ad4-bb4b-dd569663c4fd">

- **`train_on_responses_only`**: This function from `unsloth.chat_templates` modifies the training loop to specifically focus on the model's responses, excluding the instructions. This technique allows the model to better specialize in generating responses rather than understanding instructions, which can be useful in fine-tuning models for tasks like dialogue generation or question answering.

- **`instruction_part`**: Specifies the tokenized start and end markers for the user instruction. This helps to differentiate the instruction from the response, so the model learns to ignore the instruction when fine-tuning and focus only on generating the appropriate response.

- **`response_part`**: Specifies the tokenized start and end markers for the model's response. By isolating the response, the model is encouraged to generate responses that align with the given instruction but is not directly trained on the instruction itself during the process.

- **`trainer.train()`**: Initiates the training process on the dataset, where the model is specifically trained on generating accurate responses while the instructions are handled separately. This helps improve the quality of responses in tasks where the model needs to generate coherent replies based on the input conversation context.

Here in this approach, I performed instruction fine-tuning, but with a primary emphasis on **response generation** rather than directly interpreting the instruction itself. While the model is still trained to follow instructions, the core training goal is to enhance its ability to generate **contextually relevant, coherent, and accurate responses** based on the given instructions.

The reason for focusing more on responses is to make the model **more dynamic and conversational**, ensuring that it generates high-quality outputs even when the instructions are varied or complex. Instead of explicitly focusing on how well the model understands the instructions, the priority is on improving its response generation, making it better at delivering useful, human-like answers.

In this methodology, although the model is still guided by instructions (e.g., "Summarize the paragraph"), the primary focus is placed on **optimizing response generation**. The model is fine-tuned to produce **fluent, accurate, and contextually relevant responses**, ensuring it generates outputs that align with human expectations and preferences, whether the response is concise, natural, or creative.







### Inference

<img width="713" alt="Inference  1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/189c2d17-9026-4cb3-bdfb-95435b075fae">

<img width="901" alt="Inference 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea31462b-9e1c-4575-9120-5390cfbc23e2">


#### Steps for Inference

 **Prepare the Model for Inference**:  
   The fine-tuned model is loaded using `FastLanguageModel.for_inference`, ensuring compatibility with Unsloth's inference pipeline.

 **Define User Inputs**:  
   Input messages are defined explicitly to avoid unnecessary system messages.  
   **Example Input**:  
   `"ಪರಿಸರದ ಬಗ್ಗೆ ಬರೆಯಿರಿ ಮತ್ತು ಪ್ರಬಂಧವನ್ನು ಬರೆಯಿರಿ."` (Write an essay about the environment.)

 **Tokenization and Formatting**:  
   The input is tokenized using the `tokenizer` with the following options:
   - **`tokenize=True`**: To convert text into tokens.
   - **`add_generation_prompt=True`**: Ensures generation starts from the assistant's perspective.
   - **`return_tensors="pt"`**: Outputs PyTorch tensors for model compatibility.

 **Generating Responses**:  
   The fine-tuned model generates a response with:
   - **`max_new_tokens=1024`**: Defines the maximum number of tokens in the output.
   - **`temperature=1.5`**: Adds randomness to the output for creative generation.
   - **`min_p=0.1`**: Filters out less probable tokens to improve relevance.

 **Decoding and Post-Processing**:  
   Outputs are decoded and cleaned by removing unwanted metadata or system messages. This ensures the response is concise and focused.

 **Output Example**:  
   The generated response aligns with the instruction, such as providing a detailed essay on the environment in the Kannada language.

## Guide for Developers 🌿🎇✨💚🎆🌱🎇✨💚🎆 


### Fine-tuning 🌿

Dear **developers** if you are looking to build a similar project, I recommend using Google Colab as your primary environment for training and fine-tuning. Colab provides free access to GPUs (like T4 or P100) which can help speed up the process. For efficient fine-tuning, consider using PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) techniques like LoRA, which only updates a subset of the model's parameters, reducing memory usage and computational cost. You can load pre-trained models and fine-tune them in 4-bit precision, which makes training more resource-efficient. Be sure to format your dataset according to the Kannada Instruct dataset format for instruction-based tasks.
